# ComputerVision

In this respitory, my projects in Machine Vision will be added. Projects are in Python by using OpenCV and Keras dominantly.

<b>FaceDet-EmotionRec: </b> This code is written in Python. OpenCV is used to capture video from the webcam, a pretrained sophisticating face detection model is loaded from Caffe, and finally a pretrained emotion recogtion model in Keras is applied on the detected face(s). Before showing the output on screen, the label of the classified emotion is inseted on the frame of the detected face.
